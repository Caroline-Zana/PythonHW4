Two Uses for why we use inheritance in a program is one is for the allowance of 
resuing a code by referencing the behaviors and data of an object. so when a class 
inherits from another class shares all the attributes and methods of the referenced 
class. Another use for inheritance is overriding which allows you to provide their own 
implementation and overrides the other method.
